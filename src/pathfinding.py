class Pathfinding:
    """

    This class represents a pathfinding algorithm that can be used to find a path from a start point to an end point. It provides a `find_path` method which takes in the start and end points
    * as parameters and returns a list of points representing the path from the start to the end.

    Usage:
        >>> pathfinding = Pathfinding()
        >>> start = (0, 0)
        >>> end = (10, 10)
        >>> path = pathfinding.find_path(start, end)
        >>> print(path)
        [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), ..., (10, 10)]

    Methods:
        - __init__(self)
            Initializes a new instance of the class.

            :param self: The object itself.
            :type self: object

            :return: None
            :rtype: None

        - find_path(self, start, end)
            Finds a path from start to end.

            :param start: the start point of the path
            :type start: tuple[int, int]
            :param end: the end point of the path
            :type end: tuple[int, int]

            :return: a list of points representing the path from start to end
            :rtype: list[tuple[int, int]]
